# Programming Language Learning Guide

## What "Learning Syntax" Means
- The **grammar and rules** for writing valid code in that language
- How to structure commands so the computer understands them
- Like learning spelling and punctuation rules in a human language

## Key Syntax Components
- **Variables & data types**: How to declare and use them (`int x = 5;` vs `x = 5`)
- **Operators**: Symbols for math, logic, comparison (`+`, `==`, `&&`)
- **Control flow**: If/else, loops, switch statements
- **Functions**: How to define and call them
- **Comments**: Single-line (`//`) vs multi-line (`/* */`)
- **Brackets & delimiters**: `{}`, `()`, `[]`, indentation rules
- **Semicolons & line endings**: Required or optional?
- **String handling**: Single vs double quotes, concatenation

## What to Prioritize in New Languages
1. **"Hello World" basics** - Get something running fast
2. **Variable declaration** - The most common thing you'll do
3. **Control structures** - If/loops (logic is similar across languages)
4. **Function syntax** - How that specific language handles them
5. **Common gotchas** - What's different from languages you know
6. **Error messages** - Learn to read that language's compiler/interpreter feedback

## Data Types & Data Structures

### Primitive Types
- **Numbers**: int, float, double, long (precision/size matters)
- **Text**: char, string (mutable vs immutable?)
- **Boolean**: true/false (sometimes 1/0)
- **Null/None/nil**: How the language represents "nothing"

### Collections/Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Fixed vs dynamic size, zero-indexed vs one-indexed
- **Lists**: Ordered, resizable collections
- **Dictionaries/Maps/Objects**: Key-value pairs (`{"name": "John"}`)
- **Sets**: Unique values only
- **Tuples**: Immutable ordered collections
- **Stacks & Queues**: LIFO and FIFO structures

## Key Questions for Each Language
- **Type system**: Strongly typed (Java) vs loosely typed (JavaScript)?
- **Type declaration**: Explicit (`int x`) vs inferred (`var x` or `x = 5`)?
- **Mutability**: Can you change data after creation?
- **Indexing**: Arrays start at 0 or 1?
- **Built-in methods**: `.length` vs `.size()` vs `.count()`
- **Iteration syntax**: `for i in items` vs `for (int i=0; i<n; i++)`

## Essential Data Operations to Learn
- Adding/removing elements
- Accessing by index or key
- Looping through collections
- Filtering, mapping, sorting
- String manipulation (split, join, substring)
- Type conversion/casting

## Learning Strategy: Algorithms vs Data Structures

### Data Structures (Learn in EACH language)
- Hash tables/maps/dictionaries - **How to create and use**
- Stacks, queues - **Basic operations**
- Arrays, lists, sets - **Language-specific syntax**
- Know when the language has multiple options (which to use when)

**Why**: Each language implements them differently
- Python: `dict = {}`, use `list` for stacks
- JavaScript: `Map` vs objects `{}`, arrays with `.push()/.pop()`
- Java: `HashMap<K,V>`, `Stack<T>`, `Queue<T>`

### Algorithms (Learn concept ONCE)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble, merge, quick)
- Search algorithms (binary search)
- Tree traversals, graph algorithms
- **Usually use built-in implementations**

## For New Languages, Focus On
- **Built-in methods** that do the work for you
- **Syntax differences** for common operations
- **Standard library** functions (don't reinvent the wheel)
- **Where to find documentation**

## Key Insights
- Most languages share similar *concepts* but express them differently
- Focus on how *this* language writes familiar patterns
- Experienced developers look up syntax constantly
- Know *what's possible* in each language, not every detail by heart
- Learn algorithms deeply in ONE language first, then adapt to others
